# 7 Box Layout
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Here we will show different flexbox layouts, using media queries.

## Task

For this task, you only need to update the file [main.css](/main.css). The HTML has already been written for you.

Using a combination of flexbox and media queries, filfill the following requirements.

## Requirements

- Create 7 containers on the page and give each a background color
- Use the colors `purple`, `blueviolet`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `darkorange`, `red` for the containers
- Using `flex` and media queries, make the page responsive, according to the breakpoints outlined below
- Use semantic class namings to style the containers, for example, `.flex-container`, `.flex-item-1`, `.flex-item-2`
- Set the height of the containers to `150px`

#### For screen widths up to 600px

- Containers 1-7 should each take 100% of the width of a row
